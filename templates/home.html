    <h2 class="intro-subheading">Geography &amp; Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Somalia’s terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains, and highlands. Temperatures are 
      typically hot year-round, and rainfall is minimal outside of the rainy seasons. The 
      Somali Current in the Indian Ocean influences the climate along the coast, contributing 
      to distinct ecological zones and abundant marine life.
    </p>

    <h2 class="intro-subheading">People &amp; Culture</h2>
    <p>
      Somalis share a common language (Somali) and most are Sunni Muslims. Poetry, storytelling, 
      and oral traditions hold a special place in Somali culture, with a rich heritage of 
      proverbs, folk tales, and epic poetry. Somali nomadic culture has shaped values of 
      hospitality, resilience, and strong clan relationships.
    </p>

    <h2 class="intro-subheading">Economy &amp; Livelihood</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, Somalia’s economy has been centered around livestock, remittances, and 
      agriculture. Many Somalis engage in pastoralism, raising camels, goats, and sheep. In 
      urban areas, entrepreneurship and trade are key economic drivers, with bustling markets 
      offering a variety of goods. Remittances from the Somali diaspora worldwide also play 
      a major role in supporting local development and livelihoods.
